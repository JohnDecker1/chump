# Chump Code Challenge
This is a barebones application whose structure is similar to the applications we use at Stukent. It is a `React.js` application with all the bells and whistles.

## Getting Started:
1. Star this repository
2. Install the latest version of `node.js`
3. Fork this repository so you can make edits
4. `git clone` on your forked copy
5. `cd chump` on your local machine
6. `npm i` to install node modules.
7. `npm start` to start the development server
8. Go to `localhost:3031` in your browser and register.
9. Start hacking.

## Server Code
The server for Chump is already hosted for you at http://coding-challenge-js.stukent.com and open source at https://github.com/Synvox/champ.
